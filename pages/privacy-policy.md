## What information do you collect?
I use Google Analytics to collect information such as browser information, referrer information, etc. For more information, see the [Google Analytics privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US).

## How is this information used?
I use information from Google Analytics to monitor and improve this site.

## Why do you need this data?
This data helps me know what blog posts and pages do well. Since I share my work across many social media, it helps me know where most of the traffic is coming from. It also helps me understand my visitors, for example - If I see a majority of my visitors are on mobile devices, I will work on improving mobile support across my site.

All the data I collect is anonymized. That is, the data is not associated with your name or identity. To be blunt, I don't need to know who you are or what you do outside my site.
